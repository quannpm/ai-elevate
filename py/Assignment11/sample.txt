=== Query: Search latest news about AI in healthcare. ===
Here’s what’s new and trending with AI in healthcare, based on recent coverage:

- Ambient clinical documentation is moving mainstream. Microsoft announced Dragon Copilot to listen to clinician–patient visits and draft notes; Google is rolling out health‑tailored AI models to cut admin burden (weforum.org).
- 2025 is shifting from pilots to practical adoption. Health systems are showing more risk tolerance but demanding clear ROI (efficiency, cost savings) and real business value from vendors (healthtechmagazine.net).
- Generative AI interest is broadening across clinical and administrative workflows, with leaders preparing implementation roadmaps and governance (healthtechmagazine.net).
- Security and workforce readiness are top of mind. Guidance on AI security and stronger cybersecurity training for staff are rising priorities alongside deployment (healthtechmagazine.net).
- In clinics, “ambient documentation” tools are expected to capture visits in real time, summarize, and even suggest diagnoses/treatments for clinician review (news.harvard.edu).
- Medical education is embracing AI: new courses, a Ph.D. track in AI in medicine, planned tutor bots, and virtual patients for simulation at Harvard (news.harvard.edu).
- Thought leaders warn that without bold, patient‑centered priorities, the AI “revolution” could stall into incremental tweaks (news.harvard.edu).
- Organizational adoption hinges on change management: clinicians are wary from past tech disappointments, but well‑applied AI can genuinely augment workflows across roles (learn.hms.harvard.edu).

=== Query: Find recent breakthroughs in quantum computing. ===
Here are some of the most notable recent breakthroughs and trends in quantum computing:

- First operating system for quantum networks (QNodeOS): Researchers unveiled QNodeOS, designed to manage, schedule, and orchestrate tasks across quantum network nodes—a key step toward a functional quantum internet (Mar 2025, https://www.sciencedaily.com/news/computers_math/quantum_computers/).
- Longer-lived superconducting qubits: NIST and the SQMS Center report systematic nanofabrication and materials advances that improve qubit coherence, pushing best-performing devices to higher stability and fidelity—crucial for scaling and error correction (Apr 2025, https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2025/04/quantum-breakthroughs-nist-sqms-lead-way).
- Stronger quantum communication: Recent work highlights improved methods for secure quantum data transmission (e.g., more robust QKD and networking techniques), tightening the link between lab demos and deployable quantum networks (https://www.wevolver.com/article/breakthroughs-in-quantum-computing).
- Better control of quantum vibrations in solids: New laser-based techniques cool crystal vibrations (phonons) to their quantum ground state, advancing quantum transducers and interfaces that connect different types of qubits and sensors (https://phys.org/tags/quantum+computing/).
