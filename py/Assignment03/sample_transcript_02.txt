Marketing Sync - July 26, 2025
Attendees: Zeus, Lucas, Sophie, Jay

Zeus: Website traffic increased by 22% this month, mainly from the SEO blog updates.

Lucas: That’s great. However, our conversion rate from landing pages dropped slightly to 1.9%.

Sophie: I think we should experiment with different CTA placements and maybe reduce the form fields.

Jay: Also, the webinar campaign is gaining traction. We already have 300 signups, mostly from Twitter ads.

Zeus: Let’s optimize the landing pages and also prep follow-up emails for the webinar attendees.

Action Items:

Sophie to A/B test CTA placements and simplify form fields by August 2.

Lucas to review and update landing page copy by August 1.

Jay to draft webinar follow-up email series.

Next sync: August 9, 2025.
