Team Meeting - July 26, 2025
Attendees: An, Linh, Khoa, My

An: Let's get started. Linh, have you completed the user survey analysis?

Linh: Yes, I have. About 80% of users are satisfied, but many requested an advanced search feature.

Khoa: That feature will require backend support. I’ll start planning development this week.

My: On my side, I’ve finished updating the user guide for the new product version.

An: Great. Next, we need to plan the feature launch event in August. Any suggestions?

Linh: I suggest aiming for around August 15 so we have enough time for marketing.

Khoa: I agree. I’ll check if the system will be ready by then.

My: I’ll start preparing the event content and materials.

An: Excellent. Let’s recap the action items.

Action Items:

Linh to finalize the launch proposal by Thursday.

Khoa to begin planning the advanced search feature development this week.

My to prepare content and materials for the launch event by Friday.

Next meeting: August 2, 2025 at 9:30 AM.
