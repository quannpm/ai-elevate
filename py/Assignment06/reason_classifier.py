"""
This classification system combines a heuristic keyword-based classifier with a refinement layer powered by OpenAI. 
Unlike retrieval-based pipelines (which depend on a static database of examples or embeddings), this system dynamically reasons about unseen text using large language models. 
It's best suited for tasks with varied, unstructured input and where new log patterns appear frequently, making retrieval methods less effective.
